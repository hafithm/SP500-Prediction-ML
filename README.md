# SP500-Prediction-ML

ðŸš€ A Machine Learning-based approach to forecasting S&P 500 stock trends using financial indicators, historical data, and feature engineering.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Stock market prediction has always been a significant challenge due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) models to predict whether an S&P 500 stock will outperform or underperform based on historical price movements, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors.

ðŸ”¹ Goal: Predict the daily movement (Outperform vs. Underperform) of S&P 500 stocks
ðŸ”¹ Dataset: Historical stock price data & fundamental metrics from Yahoo Finance API
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Models Used:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier (alternative) 
ðŸ”¹ Key Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Yahoo Finance API
